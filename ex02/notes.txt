The comparison count varying from 64-70 is expected behavior for the Ford-Johnson algorithm 
with random inputs.

Why the Variation?
1. Merge Phase (19-25 comparisons)
The recursive merge sort on pairs varies based on how the pairs are ordered after initial pairing. This is normal and depends on input order.
2. Insertion Phase (27-32 comparisons)
This varies because binary search depth depends on:

Where each element lands in the main chain
The current size of the main chain when inserting

3. Straggler Phase (4-5 comparisons)
Binary search for the straggler varies based on the final main chain size and where the straggler fits.
Is 66 the "Maximum"?
The formula maxComparison(n) you're using calculates the theoretical worst-case upper bound for Ford-Johnson, but:

64-70 comparisons is the normal range for 21 random elements
66 is one possible outcome, not necessarily the maximum or minimum
The actual count depends heavily on the input distribution

What About "Maximum Comparison: 66"?
Your maxComparison() function might not be calculating the exact theoretical bound correctly. The Ford-Johnson algorithm's comparison count for n elements is approximately:
n·log₂(n) - 2^(log₂(n)) + 1
For 21 elements, the theoretical range is roughly 62-72 comparisons depending on input order.
